KeePass for Opera 12+
=====================

Prior to Opera 12, it was possible to easily integrate [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) with Opera, by simply setting the "Show Address In Caption" option in [opera:config](opera:config). This plugin encapsulates Jean-Fran√ßois's User Javascript-based approach into a one-click solution.

How to use
----------

1. Install plugin.

2. Use your KeePass "Auto-Type" key (usually CTRL-ALT-A) in the form you want to fill, as normal.
